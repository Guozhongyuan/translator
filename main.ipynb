peoples and to the patriots of all the fields, to the fellow members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Zone, to the fellow members of the Macao Special Administrative Zone and to the fellow members of Taiwan, and to the large number of fellow citizens of Taiwan, to the friends of all the countries concerned and supporting the modernization of China!The Companions!At the beginning of the Reform and Opening, our Party issued a great call to go on its own path and to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.Since then, our party unity has led the people of all nations of the country to struggle, to drive our economic strength, technology strength, national defense strength, comprehensive national strength into the world’s front, to drive our international position to unprecedented improvement, the face of the party, the face of the country, the face of the people, the face of the army, the face of the Chinese nation has occurred unprecedented changes, the Chinese nation is standing in a new way on the east of the world.After long efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, which is a new historical direction of our development.Socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, meaning that the Chinese nation, which has long suffered from modern times, has come with a great jump from standing up, becoming rich to strengthening, and has come with the bright prospects of achieving the great revival of the Chinese nation.It means that scientific socialism in China in the 21st century has revived a strong life and vitality, and has raised the great flag of socialism with Chinese characteristics high in the world.This means that the path, theory, institutions, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics are continuously developing, expanding the path of developing countries towards modernization, offering a whole new choice to the world’s countries and nations that both want to accelerate development and want to maintain their own independence, and contributing to the solution of human problems, the Chinese wisdom and the Chinese solution.This new era, is the era of advance, follow-up and opening, and continuing to conquer the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics under new historical conditions, is the era of determination to fully build a well-being society, and then to fully build a socialist modernized power, is the era of the people of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations of all nations.Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the main social contradictions in China have turned into the contradictions between the growing needs of a better life of the people and the unbalanced and insufficient development.China has solved the problem of the warmness of a billion people, achieved the overall well-being, will soon fully build a well-being society, the needs of the people for a good life are increasingly widespread, not only the material and cultural life is increasingly demanded, but the demands in democracy, the rule of law, justice, justice, security, the environment and so on are increasingly growing.At the same time, the level of social productivity in China has increased significantly in general, the social productivity capacity has entered the world’s top in many aspects, and the more outstanding problem is the development of imbalance and insufficiency, which has become the main restrictive factor to meet the growing needs of the people for a better life.It must be understood that the main changes in our society are historical changes in relation to the overall situation, and many new demands have been imposed on the work of the party and the state.On the basis of continuing to promote development, we must strive to solve the problem of good development imbalance and insufficiency, strongly improve the quality and efficiency of development, better satisfy the growing needs of people in economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and other aspects, and better promote the comprehensive development of people and the comprehensive social progress.The Companions!Socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, has a significant significance in the history of development of the People's Republic of China and in the history of development of the Chinese nation, and has a significant significance in the history of development of socialism in the world and in the history of human and social development.The whole party must have a firm confidence and effort to do so, so that socialism with Chinese characteristics may demonstrate a stronger vitality!The historic mission of the New Age of the Communist Party of China, a hundred years ago, the October revolution sounded and sent Marxism to China.The Chinese advancers see the way to solve the Chinese problem from the scientific truth of Marxist-Leninism.In the intense movement of the postmodern Chinese society, in the intense struggle of the Chinese people against the feudal rule and foreign aggression, in the process of the combination of Marxism and Leninism with the Chinese workers movement, the Communist Party of China was born in 1921.Since then, the Chinese people seek national independence, the people's liberation and the struggle for the country's wealthy and people's happiness have had the main heart, and the Chinese people have changed from spiritual to passive initiative.The Chinese people have more than five thousand years of civilization history, created a brilliant Chinese civilization, made an excellent contribution to humanity and became the greatest nation in the world.After the opium war, China fell into the darkness of internal concerns and external suffering, the Chinese people suffered the deep suffering of war frequency, mountains broken, and people don’t talk about it.For the national rebuilding, countless Gentiles and Gentiles were unbeatable, former servants followed, carried out a cryful struggle, conducted various attempts, but eventually failed to change the social nature of the old China and the tragic fate of the Chinese people.Achieving the great rise of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation since modern times.Once the Communist Party of China was established, it took the realisation of Communism as the highest ideal and final goal of the Party, it took on its historical mission to the great resurrection of the Chinese nation, it joined the people to conduct a hard struggle and excellence, and it wrote the magnificent poem of the Rainbow River.Our party is deeply aware that in order to the great rise of the Chinese nation, it is necessary to overthrow the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism on the head of the Chinese people, to national independence, people's liberation, state unity, and social stability.Our party unity leads the people to find a right revolutionary path to the urban surroundings and armed conquest of the regime, conducted twenty-eight years of bloody struggle, completed the new-democratic revolution, established the People's Republic of China in 1949 and achieved the great jump of China from several thousand years of feudal authoritarian politics to people's democracy.Our party is deeply aware that in order to the great revival of the Chinese nation, it is necessary to establish an advanced social system that meets our own reality.Our party unity led the people to complete the socialist revolution, establish the socialist basic system, advance the socialist construction, complete the widespread and deepest social change ever in the history of the Chinese nation, put the basic political prerequisites and institutional basis for all the development of the contemporary China, achieved the great jump of the Chinese nation from the constant decline of the modern to the fundamental reversal of the fate, the continued journey towards prosperity and wealth.Our Party is deeply aware that achieving the great rise of the Chinese nation must be in accordance with the trend of the time, in accordance with the will of the people, in courage to reform and open up, and in order to keep the Party and the people’s affairs always full of courage and courage to move forward.Our party unity led the people to reform and open the new great revolution, to break down all the ideological and institutional barriers that block the development of the country and the nation, to open the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, to make China a big step towards the time.For ninety-six years, in order to accomplish the historical mission of the great Renaissance of the Chinese nation, whether weak or strong, whether well or disadvantaged, our party is initially unchanged, unwilling, united to lead the people through thousands of difficulties and risks, pay a huge sacrifice, dare to face turmoil, dare to correct errors, overcome one and one seemingly untouchable difficulties, and create one and one human miracle.The Companions!Today, we are closer than any time in history, more confident and capable of achieving the goal of the great resurrection of the Chinese nation.One hundred and a half nine.The great resurrection of the Chinese nation is not possible to easily and easily.The whole party must be prepared to make more difficult and more difficult efforts.To a great dream, a great struggle must be carried out.The society is moving forward in the conflict movement, there is conflict and there is struggle.Our Party must unite to lead the people to effectively respond to major challenges, resist major risks, overcome major resistance, solve major contradictions, must conduct great struggles with many new historical characteristics, and any desire to enjoy, negative misleading, and avoiding contradictions is wrong.The whole party must more consciously adhere to the party’s leadership and to our socialist system, and strongly oppose all the words of weakening, distortion and denial of the party’s leadership and of our socialist system.More consciously protect the interests of the people, and strongly oppose all acts that harm the interests of the people, and take away from the crowds;More consciously engage in the trend of the reform and innovation era, and resolutely eradicate all the impotence;More consciously protect our sovereignty, security and development interests, and strongly oppose all actions that divide the homeland, destroy national unity and social harmony and stability;More consciously prevent various risks and resolutely overcome all difficulties and challenges that arise in political, economic, cultural, social and natural fields.The whole party must fully understand the long-term, complexity, and hardness of this great struggle, develop the spirit of struggle, improve the struggle, and constantly gain the new victory of the great struggle.To a great dream, it is necessary to build a great project.This great project is the new great project for the building of the party that our party is deepening forward.History has and will continue to prove that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, national revival is necessarily a imagination.Our Party must always be the pioneer of the time, the national pillar, always be the ruling party of Marxism, and must always be too hard.The whole party must more consciously establish the party principle, be courageous to face the problem, be courageous to scratch the bone, eliminate all the factors that harm the party’s advancement and purity, eliminate all the viruses that erod the party’s healthy muscles, constantly enhance the party’s political leadership, thought leadership, mass organizational strength, and social calling, and ensure that our party will always be vital and strong fighting.To a great dream, it is necessary to advance a great
